# Restaurant Recommendation System

This repository contains the code implementation and documentation for the cuisine classification model developed as part of the internship project at Cognifyz Technologies.

## Overview

In this project, we aimed to develop a cuisine classification model for restaurant recommendation systems. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we categorized restaurants based on their cuisines to enhance user experiences and provide personalized dining suggestions.

## Key Features

- Data collection from reliable sources including online review platforms.
- Preprocessing steps including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Model development using Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- Analysis of biases and challenges in the model's performance across different cuisines.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mhari2410/cognifyz_task3
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `cuisine_classification.ipynb` to execute the code implementation.

2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for model training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook for the project implementation.
- `docs/`: Documentation files including the project report and README.
